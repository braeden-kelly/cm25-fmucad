- Reasons why
  - Minimize latency 
  - Many databases save to cache already
  - Can implement failovers
- Redis can be thought of as giant hash table
- Hashes are faster but json is more convenient
  - Use json unless you're doing embeddings 
- Slight performance boost using unlink instead of delete
- Atomic consistent isolated durable (acid)
